# Fundamentals-Capstone-Project
In this capstone project for the Introductory Course, I was asked to find a dataset and explore/visualize it.


I'm going to try another branch/pull/merge. I'm creating this ReadMe so I can edit it in GitHub Desktop, which is the tool I'll be replacing Google Drive with.

Here is the edit, done in Notepad++! Woo, look at me go! :D
