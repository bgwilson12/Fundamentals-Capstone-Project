# Fundamentals-Capstone-Project
In this capstone project for the Introductory Course, I was asked to find a dataset and explore/visualize it.


I'm going to try another branch/pull/merge. I'm creating this ReadMe so I can edit it in GitHub Desktop, which is the tool I'll be replacing Google Drive with.

Here is the edit, done in Notepad++! Woo, look at me go! :D

Here is another edit. I think I'm getting how this all works now. Instead of having Google Drive automatically update the links I submitted to Thinkful's site, I just work like I normally do and have to push (pull? merge? still don't know the terminology) my changes when I'm finished working.

By the way, I will change this readme in the future to a better description of my project.
